### Data Stewardship

Preserving the actual physical artifacts making up the _archaeological_ record is probably what most people think of when they think about stewardship in archaeology, but that, while critically important (and probably the highest priority, too), is not _all_ that stewardship entails. It's also about preserving, if you will, our _record_ of the record, or our _knowledge_ of it. In the digitial world we live in today, where data grows at a rate impossible for any one person to manage, stewardship is also about making archaeological data __F__indable, __A__ccessible, __I__nteroperable, and __R__eusable, in a word, to make it [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618). This is something I am passionate about contributing to, especially for our record of western North America.  


### Climate, Conflict, and Human Migration

Looking at the intersection between climate, environment, demography, and conflict through the lens of behavioral ecology, our goal is to understand what socioenvironmental conditions consistently promote conflict over cooperation. We do this be evaluating the relative costs and benefits of organizing and participating in violent conflict across various physical and social contexts. 


### Paleoindian settlement of the Great Basin

_Excerpt from NSF abstract_: Explaining how humans adapt to climate change and population growth remain central research questions in anthropology and are relevant to contemporary issues. About fourteen thousand years ago, ancestral Native Americans first entered the Great Basin of North America, where they encountered a landscape dominated by large inland lakes and marshes. Although the climate was generally cooler and wetter than today, it was highly variable and experienced dramatic shifts associated with the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene epochs. Nonetheless, early Native Americans developed a stable adaptation, characterized by a flexible technology and subsistence base, and high mobility that persevered over the ensuing six millennia, but dramatically reorganized with the onset of extreme aridity about 8,000 years ago. Understanding how these first Americans made a living, interacted with one another, and adapted to climatic change is critical to explaining the colonization of the Americas, and how humans adapt to changing environments more generally.
