## RESEARCH STATEMENT

I'm an archaeologist and environmental data scientist whose research focuses on
understanding the origins and resilience of urban systems â€“ paradigmatically,
cities â€“ under changing demographic and climatic conditions. This is a hefty
topic, of course, with a lot of moving parts, so I have recently settled on
something of a divide-and-conquer strategy, splitting the problem up into the
following set of smaller and hopefully more manageable questions:

1.  **Location:** why do human settlements get established where they do?
2.  **Size:** why do some human settlements grow larger than others?
3.  **Longevity:** why do some human settlements last longer than others?

These questions target critical aspects of urban socio-economic organization, so
they also offer an important opportunity to study an increasingly urgent
dimension of human adaptation to climate change, namely, urban adaptation to
climate change. A growing body of evidence points to the critical role of urban
systems for past populations coping with climate crises. Its importance to
combating current and future climate change has also been recognized by the
IPCC, which for its [7th Assessment Report
Cycle](https://www.ipcc.ch/2024/01/19/ipcc-60-ar7-work-programme/), will include
a special report on climate change and cities.

To study urbanism, I draw on an integrated set of conceptual tools from
behavioral and population ecology, urban geography, and economics, coupled with
multiple lines of evidence, including reconstructions of climate, demography,
and archaeological settlement systems, as well as estimates of diet, health,
violence, and inequality. As these socio-ecological dynamics are also inherently
spatial processes, they raise their own unique set of challenges (notably,
autocorrelation) that in turn require their own unique set of solutions (namely,
spatial statistics), so I invest considerable time and energy into advancing
spatial and environmental data science in anthropology, ecology, and other
allied fields. Below, I provide some examples of these efforts, along with some
suggestions of how I intend to build on them into the future.

### [Previous Research]{.kobe}

A lot of my previous research has focused on the location problem, which my
collaborators and I have sought to address by combining inductive Species
Distribution Models (SDMs) from ecology with the theoretical Ideal Free
Distribution model from population ecology, with several papers coming out of
that effort. One compares different regression and machine-learning algorithms
for fitting SDMs to archaeological point pattern data.[^1] Another uses a
popular machine-learning SDM known as MaxEnt to compare settlement strategies
among prehistoric foragers and farmers in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National
Monument.[^2] And a third uses a simple Poisson SDM to evaluate the origins of
agriculture in western Utah.[^3]

I am also involved in ongoing ethnographic research within a traditional
ranching community in Baja California Sur, Mexico. As part of that project, I
built a series of models to examine the ways in which ranchers in that community
balance the benefits of market integration with the necessities of rural life,
with an emphasis on how infrastructure development can upend that calculus.[^4]

### [Current and Future Research]{.kobe}

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Behavioral Science
at CU Boulder. The position is supported by an NSF grant (Award No.
[#2213921](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2213921)) involving
a large collaboration between tribal representatives and researchers from
multiple disciplines (geography, anthropology, data science, and climate
science). A major goal of the project is to develop archaeological proxies for
UN sustainable development goals, including economic growth, equality, and
health, so that we can then model the sustainable development of small-scale
agricultural communities in the US Southwest before the Spanish entrada (from
roughly 800 to 1600 CE). As part of this project, I developed a method â€“ heavily
inspired by the US Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s concept of a Core Based
Statistical Area â€“ for defining the territorial extent of dispersed farming
communities based on the size and spatial distribution of agricultural
settlements.[^5]

    dispersed community territories**. *Journal of Archaeological Science*.

My current plan for tackling the size and longevity questions involves the use
of Spatial Interaction Models and Survival Analysis.[^6] However, I first need
to get a handle on population reconstruction, which requires the use of spatial
interpolation methods, in this case something like regression kriging, as we
wish to leverage information about artifact assemblages at directly dated
archaeological sites, and then incorporate information about the spatial
structure of the residuals. As we are more concerned with prediction rather than
explanation in this case, it makes sense to go all-in on black-box methods, so I
am experimenting with a deep learning, Bayesian Neural Network model that
incorporates Moran Eigenvector Maps to handle spatial dependence. Ultimately,
the goal is to build the framework into a Rust crate because of that languageâ€™s
performance advantages, and then wrap that crate in an R package to make it more
accessible to the scientific community. This will be followed up by papers in
the Journal of Open Source Software and the Journal of Archaeological Science.

Finally, I continue to be an active contributor to a number of projects that
directly or indirectly support environmental data science research. Perhaps most
notably, I am a contributor to ESRIâ€™s officially supported
[{arcgisutils}](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils) suite of R packages,
which provide tools for working with ArcGIS Online REST APIs. I have also helped
maintain the [{paleocar}](https://github.com/bocinsky/paleocar) R package, which
implements functions for spatio-temporal paleoclimate reconstruction using
tree-rings and modern climate data (usually PRISM). And I contribute to the
[{extendr}](https://github.com/extendr/extendr) project that provides bindings
for R and Rust. I am involved in this project because I have a strong desire to
make a lot of extremely costly data processing that is common in archaeology and
other social sciences more type safe and performant by porting it from R to
Rust, then wrapping the resulting Rust code in R so that researchers can take
advantage of Rust without having to learn it themselves.
