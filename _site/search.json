Here are a few more labels I’m happy to embrace: pragmatist, naturalist, scientist, humanist, anthropologist, behavioral ecologist, geographer, historian, environmental data scientist, programmer, recovering philosopher, and nerd.\nIn case you were wondering, this is me:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one on the left was taken on a survey in Nine Mile Canyon, Utah. That would have been the Before Times, so maybe 500 years ago. The one on the right is the same photo passed to ChatGPT with the request that it make me look like a Jim Henson muppet. When asked to provide more details, I said, “Use Bert and Ernie as inspiration.”\n\n\nCurrently, I’m a One-U Responsible AI Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Utah. My work as a fellow is narrowly focused on a specific aspect of my broader research, namely, climate adaptation in agricultural systems, particularly those related to water usage. The immediate goal is to develop an encoder-decoder hydrological model (EDHM) that can estimate soil moisture and streamflow, both of which have obvious importance to farmers. The larger ambition, though, is to contribute to the overall mission of One-U RAI - to the promotion of responsible AI - by making that modeling effort as open, as interpretable, and as accessible as possible to both scientists and community stakeholders. The hope is that it will contribute to strategic climate adaptation planning, too.\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, my research focuses on the ecology of human behavior, with a particular emphasis on spatial dynamics. Here is a list of the specific topics and questions that really animate me these days:\n\nClimate adaptation and migration: in very abstract terms, how do people distribute themselves across space, and how is that influenced over the long term by climate trends? For this, I usually draw on species distribution modeling approaches from ecology, including machine learning approaches like Random Forest and Maximum Entropy, though I also find my attention drawn more and more to INLA models, too.\nThe micro-economics of early, early, early urbanism: like, how did we get from small, dispersed groups of mobile hunter-gatherers to large concentrations of sedentary city dwellers? I’m attracted to this problem mostly because it’s a spatial problem, but there’s also this other really weird thing about cities that I find deeply fascinating: how it is that they can exhibit such dramatic scaling effects while still failing utterly to resolve the problem of collective action.\nDemographic interpolation: how do we estimate population size without a census? There is a lot of neat work on this using remote-sensed measures of built area to interpolate modern populations across a grid, but transferring those efforts over to deep time raises an interesting problem, namely, that built area in that context is a palimpsest (like the many layers of ancient Troy), which requires that we estimate both a chronology and a population size at the same time. The current statistical approaches I find interesting for this include Gaussian and Dirichlet Process Mixture Models, as well as their deep learning analogs.\n\nIn my spare time, I contribute to several FOSS projects in the R community."
