##### Anthropology
My research draws on behavioral ecology to understand the social and environmental factors driving variation in human behavior. In particular, I study how individuals navigate the difficult challenges posed by conflict and climate change, and how their decisions affect their local ecology, as well as their own community's resilience and sustainability.  

##### Archaeology
Mostly, my work focuses on past behavior. I rely on geographic and spatial modeling techniques to understand not only how but _why_ individuals chose to confront the challenges of climate and conflict as they did, particularly in marginal environments like the arid American West. 

##### Data Science
I devote considerable time and energy to organizing data collected on public lands and making it more accessible for research and preservation. I am also passionate about using data science for education. Whether I am teaching in the classroom, mentoring student researchers, or interacting with the public, I want to expand the archaeological neighborhood within the wider community of science, making it a more diverse and equitable institution.
