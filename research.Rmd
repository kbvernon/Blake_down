### Data science

While I dabble in some of the more glamorous elements of the digital revolution in archaeology, like adapting new analytical methods to archaeological data, the vast majority of my time and energy revolves around data stewardship, specifically

1. Digitizing paper site records. This is not just about scanning them to PDF, but translating them into machine-readable and rectangular data structures. My efforts here are mostly focused in the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments, but I would like to see the entire record of Utah be digitized in this manner.  
2. Building online storage systems. The goal here is to make it easier for researchers and land managers to access that information while also meeting state and federal requirements for protecting archaeological resources.

While archaeologists have gone to heroic lengths to address these issues, a lot - and I mean A LOT - of work remains to be done. And, that's not a bad thing! In fact, it's an opportunity. I have found that working with archaeological site records provides an excellent educational opportunity for students, introducing them to archaeological data and methods, as well as a region's prehistory, and even the history of archaeology itself.  



### Paleoindian settlement of the Great Basin

_Excerpt from NSF abstract_: Explaining how humans adapt to climate change and population growth remain central research questions in anthropology and are relevant to contemporary issues. About fourteen thousand years ago, ancestral Native Americans first entered the Great Basin of North America, where they encountered a landscape dominated by large inland lakes and marshes. Although the climate was generally cooler and wetter than today, it was highly variable and experienced dramatic shifts associated with the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene epochs. Nonetheless, early Native Americans developed a stable adaptation, characterized by a flexible technology and subsistence base, and high mobility that persevered over the ensuing six millennia, but dramatically reorganized with the onset of extreme aridity about 8,000 years ago. Understanding how these first Americans made a living, interacted with one another, and adapted to climatic change is critical to explaining the colonization of the Americas, and how humans adapt to changing environments more generally.
