### __Kenneth Blake Vernon__

![](/figures/Comb_Ridge.jpg)

I'm a __behavioral ecologist__ with a peculiar interest in our own species - how we find so many different ways to be human, yet being human is something we all share - so that would, I guess, make me an __anthropologist__ too. And because the humans I study lived long ago - and because I have a fondness for digging in the dirt - I suppose I'm an __archaeologist__ as well. I use geographic and spatial modeling techniques to investigate the nexus of climate, conflict, and human migration, focusing on the prehistory of the American Southwest. A lot of my time is spent developing methods to advance archaeological data management and data science both for research and preservation.
