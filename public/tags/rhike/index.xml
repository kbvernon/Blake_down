      <description>I wanted to learn how to write an R package and I had this recurrent use-case (estimating cost-distance on a grid), so I made rHike. It’s a super-lightweight package that builds on Jacob van Etten’s gdistance by implementing both Tobler’s (1993) and Campbell’s (2019) hiking functions, though others could be added. Mainly, it just simplifies the user interface. Development mostly followed the workflow suggested by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan in their R Packages book.</description>
