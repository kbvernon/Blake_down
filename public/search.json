The painstaking effort of organizing that data and making it more accessible is not particularly flashy, not in the way that a publication is anyway, but I have found that it bears fruit beyond the obvious contributions to research. In particular, it promotes a constructive feedback loop between research and education, offering students tons of opportunities to transform their own curiosity into well-formed questions that they can then explore with the data they are already gathering.\r\nData science remains a largely untapped reservoir of research potential in archaeology. For instance, it promotes greater collaboration, which is increasingly important for investigating very complex issues in our discipline. In my experience, I have also found that this feature of data science, when done carefully, serves to promote a more inclusive community of science, I am very passionate about this, so I devote a lot of my time and energy to developing tools and methods that will advance archaeological data management and data science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
