This page provides a broad overview of the general research topics that motivate me. For details about the specific questions I have explored in my research, see my [publications](./publications.html) page.

### The digital revolution in archaeology

Every day now, archaeologists discover new, ingenious ways to digitize virtually every aspect of their research. While I dabble in some of the more glamorous elements of that process, like adapting new analytical methods to archaeological data (typically from ecology and geography), the vast majority of my time and energy revolves around (1) digitizing existing analog site records and other archaeological data sets and (2) building new online storage systems that make it easier for researchers and land managers to access archaeological data while also meeting state and federal requirements for protecting archaeological resources.

The big challenge here is a familiar one. Archaeological site records maintained by State Historic Preservation Offices in the United States exist largely as paper records or scanned PDFs, meaning you can't just Google something like _How many Fremont pithouses are there in Daggett County, Utah?_ and hope to get an answer. While heroic efforts have been made to address this issue, archaeology as a whole has not made the same concerted push that, for instance, the medical industry did in the late 2000s. So, a lot of work remains to be done. And, that's not a bad thing! In fact, it's an opportunity. I have found, for example, that working with archaeological site records provides an excellent educational opportunity for students. It also gives them a chance to ask questions they would never have thought to raise otherwise, which often leads them down the path of scientific inquiry.  



### The Paleoindian settlement of the Great Basin

_Excerpt from NSF abstract_: Explaining how humans adapt to climate change and population growth remain central research questions in anthropology and are relevant to contemporary issues. About fourteen thousand years ago, ancestral Native Americans first entered the Great Basin of North America, where they encountered a landscape dominated by large inland lakes and marshes. Although the climate was generally cooler and wetter than today, it was highly variable and experienced dramatic shifts associated with the transition from the Pleistocene to Holocene epochs. Nonetheless, early Native Americans developed a stable adaptation, characterized by a flexible technology and subsistence base, and high mobility that persevered over the ensuing six millennia, but dramatically reorganized with the onset of extreme aridity about 8,000 years ago. Understanding how these first Americans made a living, interacted with one another, and adapted to climatic change is critical to explaining the colonization of the Americas, and how humans adapt to changing environments more generally.
