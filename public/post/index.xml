      <description>updated: May 13, 2020 (replaced Laplace with Lorentz distribution at Campbell’s suggestion)
I wanted to learn how to write an R package and I had this recurrent use-case (estimating cost-distance on a grid), so I made rHike. It’s a super-lightweight package that builds on Jacob van Etten’s gdistance by implementing both Tobler’s (1993) and Campbell’s (2019) hiking functions, though others could be added. Mainly, it just simplifies the user interface.</description>

      <description>While I’m learning how to build a Hugo website with the blogdown package in R, I thought I’d share this code for generating an interactive leaflet map. It has a choropleth overlay representing the number of weeks of archaeological fieldwork I’ve done in each US county. To make this map, I am relying on Tim Applehans’ incredibly helpful R package mapview.</description>
