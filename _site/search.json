    "text": "LAST UPDATED\n2024-08-21\nDISCLAIMER\nMy teaching philosophy is inspired by the American style of pragmatism I learned from my old friend and mentor, Norbert Schedler, a former Lutheran minister who stumbled upon the heretical writings of intellectuals like Nietzsche and Darwin and basically never looked back. He got his PhD at Princeton, taught at Purdue and Berkeley, and then decided the academic rat race wasn’t for him, so he took a position at a small teaching college in the middle of nowhere, Arkansas, where he could focus on his family and his teaching. He would often say that our primary duty as educators and intellectuals and even as citizens is to “keep the conversation going!” You can think of the following statement as trying to articulate how I keep the conversation going in my own teaching and mentoring, and for that matter, in my research, too."

    "text": "Teaching Statement\nI like to think of my teaching and mentoring as just one small part of a much larger and much more ambitious social-engineering project called higher education. There are many roles such a project can and often does play in a society, but three in particular stand out for me. First, and perhaps most obviously, it facilitates the inter-generational transfer of our accumulated knowledge and wisdom. Second, it promotes the civic virtues that we rely on as a free and open society, like openness to new ideas, courage in pursuing the truth, and respect for those we might disagree with, to name just a few. Third, it serves as an instrument of justice, of fairness and equality, whether that be in our economy, our environment, or our social lives. I believe that these ends - knowledge, justice, and virtue - are coincident in practice, meaning they rise and fall as one. Together with the arts, they are also the primary engines of human flourishing.\nInvoking such mighty goals, of course, is easy, pursuing them, not so much. I mean, it’s not like signposts reading “Justice, this way” are lying about pointing the way. Still, the goals of education would seem to recommend a certain pedagogy or prescription for teaching that I would put like this:\n\nTry to meet students where they are, to speak their language.1\n\nI would go so far as to say this is the core idea that animates everything I do as an educator. It also entails a number of more concrete rules for action, which I now enumerate with examples from my own experience.\nBe sensitive to the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and interests of students. You cannot possibly meet students where they are if you do not know where that is, so I conduct a number of early assignments and tests with my students, including a pre-course assessment, that are designed to provide information about their current knowledge and interests. I also use informal, through-course assessments (what normal people would call small talk) to learn more about them. Basically, I just try to treat them like they’re adults.\nRe-contextualize ideas, then re-contextualize them some more. Underlying the injunction to speak your student’s language is the old rationalist idea that learning a new concept, like learning a new word, involves a lot of translation back and forth into a more familiar idiom. For me, in practice, that means using lots of examples, placing the concept in a more familiar context, seeing how it gets used there and what its use entails, then slowly walking it through less and less familiar settings, all the while asking students to think about and discuss its shifting implications. Naturally, that includes traditional lecture, but I also offer students lots of opportunities to try out translating ideas through lab and other exercises involving problems from the ordinary and everyday to the ethnographic and archaeological.\nManage expectations, both yours and your students, don’t demand too much or too little! Translating new ideas into your own words can be difficult, often frustratingly so. Over time, though, the translating gets easier, eventually becoming unnecessary. But, that’s not something that just happens over night. Usually, you have to immerse yourself in a new idea, live with it day by day, just as one would need to do to really learn a new language. This is a point I try to impress upon my students at every occasion, especially when they are feeling discouraged, like they aren’t learning the materials fast enough, are getting left behind, or not living up to expectations. In such circumstances, I tell them that one class will not an expert make, that expertise might not even be the goal! Sometimes a basic familiarity will suffice for what they really want to learn or do, and that’s OK.\nInvite them into the conversation. This is my preferred way of describing what most folks in the academy would call “active learning” as it emphasizes that the learning in this case is participatory, meaning the student does not just learn how to, say, move liquids with a pipette or calibrate a scale, but to engage critically with the scientific process, to step up and make their own moves in the wider conversation of science. As a graduate student at the University of Utah, I had the good fortune to mentor a lot of undergraduate researchers - dozens of them, actually - from all walks of life, mostly through my role as Assistant Director of the Archaeological Center. It’s easily one of the most rewarding things I did as a graduate student at the U, and something I look forward to continuing into the future.\nBut, also have some perspective. In the social sciences and humanities, we need to be more cognizant of the possibility that encouraging students to pursue careers in our disciplines might do little more than subject them to a life of penury. The best way we can do that is by teaching “transferable skills.” For me, that mostly means teaching them data science skills, specifically quantitative reasoning or statistics and computer programming."

    "section": "RESEARCH STATEMENT",
    "text": "RESEARCH STATEMENT\nI’m an archaeologist and environmental data scientist whose research focuses on understanding the origins and resilience of urban systems – paradigmatically, cities – under changing demographic and climatic conditions. This is a hefty topic, of course, with a lot of moving parts, so I have recently settled on something of a divide-and-conquer strategy, splitting the problem up into the following set of smaller and hopefully more manageable questions:\n\nLocation: why do human settlements get established where they do?\nSize: why do some human settlements grow larger than others?\nLongevity: why do some human settlements last longer than others?\n\nThese questions target critical aspects of urban socio-economic organization, so they also offer an important opportunity to study an increasingly urgent dimension of human adaptation to climate change, namely, urban adaptation to climate change. A growing body of evidence points to the critical role of urban systems for past populations coping with climate crises. Its importance to combating current and future climate change has also been recognized by the IPCC, which for its 7th Assessment Report Cycle, will include a special report on climate change and cities.\nTo study urbanism, I draw on an integrated set of conceptual tools from behavioral and population ecology, urban geography, and economics, coupled with multiple lines of evidence, including reconstructions of climate, demography, and archaeological settlement systems, as well as estimates of diet, health, violence, and inequality. As these socio-ecological dynamics are also inherently spatial processes, they raise their own unique set of challenges (notably, autocorrelation) that in turn require their own unique set of solutions (namely, spatial statistics), so I invest considerable time and energy into advancing spatial and environmental data science in anthropology, ecology, and other allied fields. Below, I provide some examples of these efforts, along with some suggestions of how I intend to build on them into the future.\n\nPrevious Research\nA lot of my previous research has focused on the location problem, which my collaborators and I have sought to address by combining inductive Species Distribution Models (SDMs) from ecology with the theoretical Ideal Free Distribution model from population ecology, with several papers coming out of that effort. One compares different regression and machine-learning algorithms for fitting SDMs to archaeological point pattern data.1 Another uses a popular machine-learning SDM known as MaxEnt to compare settlement strategies among prehistoric foragers and farmers in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.2 And a third uses a simple Poisson SDM to evaluate the origins of agriculture in western Utah.3\nI am also involved in ongoing ethnographic research within a traditional ranching community in Baja California Sur, Mexico. As part of that project, I built a series of models to examine the ways in which ranchers in that community balance the benefits of market integration with the necessities of rural life, with an emphasis on how infrastructure development can upend that calculus.4\n\n\nCurrent and Future Research\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Behavioral Science at CU Boulder. The position is supported by an NSF grant (Award No. #2213921) involving a large collaboration between tribal representatives and researchers from multiple disciplines (geography, anthropology, data science, and climate science). A major goal of the project is to develop archaeological proxies for UN sustainable development goals, including economic growth, equality, and health, so that we can then model the sustainable development of small-scale agricultural communities in the US Southwest before the Spanish entrada (from roughly 800 to 1600 CE). As part of this project, I developed a method – heavily inspired by the US Office of Management and Budget’s concept of a Core Based Statistical Area – for defining the territorial extent of dispersed farming communities based on the size and spatial distribution of agricultural settlements.5\nMy current plan for tackling the size and longevity questions involves the use of Spatial Interaction Models and Survival Analysis.6 However, I first need to get a handle on population reconstruction, which requires the use of spatial interpolation methods, in this case something like regression kriging, as we wish to leverage information about artifact assemblages at directly dated archaeological sites, and then incorporate information about the spatial structure of the residuals. As we are more concerned with prediction rather than explanation in this case, it makes sense to go all-in on black-box methods, so I am experimenting with a deep learning, Bayesian Neural Network model that incorporates Moran Eigenvector Maps to handle spatial dependence. Ultimately, the goal is to build the framework into a Rust crate because of that language’s performance advantages, and then wrap that crate in an R package to make it more accessible to the scientific community. This will be followed up by papers in the Journal of Open Source Software and the Journal of Archaeological Science.\nFinally, I continue to be an active contributor to a number of projects that directly or indirectly support environmental data science research. Perhaps most notably, I am a contributor to ESRI’s officially supported {arcgisutils} suite of R packages, which provide tools for working with ArcGIS Online REST APIs. I have also helped maintain the {paleocar} R package, which implements functions for spatio-temporal paleoclimate reconstruction using tree-rings and modern climate data (usually PRISM). And I contribute to the {extendr} project that provides bindings for R and Rust. I am involved in this project because I have a strong desire to make a lot of extremely costly data processing that is common in archaeology and other social sciences more type safe and performant by porting it from R to Rust, then wrapping the resulting Rust code in R so that researchers can take advantage of Rust without having to learn it themselves."
