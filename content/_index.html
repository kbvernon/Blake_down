<p>I’m a <strong>behavioral ecologist</strong> with a peculiar interest in our own species; how we find so many different ways to be human, yet being human is something we all share.* I want to understand that, how we can be one and many at the same time, so I guess I’m an <strong>anthropologist</strong> too. And because the humans I study lived long ago - and because I have a fondness for digging in the dirt - I suppose I’m an <strong>archaeologist</strong> as well. I use geographic and spatial modeling techniques to investigate the nexus of climate, conflict, and human migration, focusing on the prehistory of the American Southwest. A lot of my time is spent developing methods to advance archaeological data management and data science both for research and preservation.</p>
